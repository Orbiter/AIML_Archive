This is the standard set of AIML files modified to work properly with Program E.


1. std-*.aiml
  The basic standard set, should be guaranteed as compliant with
  a given level of AIML.  They are becoming a "generic" reference, with as
  many personality and gender specific categories removed as possible.
 
2. dev-*.aiml
  Experimental set, should vary from bot to bot.
  They contain proprietary/experimental/work-in-progress AIML.
 
3. per-*.aiml
  Equivalent to std-*.aiml but with a customization of the bot
  personality; this is a work of a specific botmaster.
